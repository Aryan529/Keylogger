# Keylogger
Here I have made Keylogger in Python which can not just monitor what the individual is composing and furthermore take screen captures parallelly.
# How to use?
1. First of all you need to install all the mentioned python libraries in your device (Here i am assuming that latest Python version is installed in your device).
<br/><b>Write the following commands in the cmd window:</b>

```
pip install mss
```

```
pip install pynput
```


```
pip install threading
```


```
pip install os
```

2. Once you are done with all these libraries, you can download the "Keylogger.py" script and open it in any of the Python IDE(Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, IDLE..)
<br/>
3. Now, when you Run the script it will ask for "A Time interval which you want to be there in between each interval" and once you give the input then the keyogger will start tracking.
<br/>
<br />
This Keylogger will make a new Directory on the Desktop named "Keylogger" where all the Screenshots and log file will be stored.

# How to Stop?
In order to stop this Keylogger, you have to stop the python script.
